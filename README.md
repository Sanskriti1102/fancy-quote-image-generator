## 📌 What is this project about?

The **Fancy Quote Image Generator** is a creative web app designed to turn simple quotes into **beautiful, branded images** ready to share.  
Great for motivational reels, speaker posts, podcasts, or even academic wisdom bombs 💣.

## 💡 Why did I build this?

As a podcaster and tech mentor, I saw a major gap: **everyone has a quote to share**, but no one has time to design it.  
So I created a way to automate the beauty — one quote at a time.
